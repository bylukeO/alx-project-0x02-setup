Next.js Project Setup and Basics.
# 📌 Introduction

Welcome to the **ALX Project 0x02** repository — a comprehensive beginner-to-intermediate level project that introduces the fundamentals of building modern web applications using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project serves as a hands-on learning experience that walks you through scaffolding a new Next.js app, setting up a clean project structure, creating reusable UI components, implementing routing, managing state, and fetching data from external APIs.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By working through this project, you will:

- Scaffold a Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Implement routing with the Next.js Pages Router
- Build reusable, type-safe components using TypeScript interfaces
- Create interactive UI elements such as modals and buttons
- Integrate and display data from external APIs (e.g., JSONPlaceholder)
- Apply best practices in folder structure, state management, and styling
- Design responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run or contribute to this project, you’ll need:

- **Node.js** v16 or later
- **npm** or **yarn**
- Basic knowledge of **React** and **TypeScript**
- Familiarity with **HTML** and **CSS**
- A **GitHub** account
- A code editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## 🧠 Best Practices

### 📁 Project Structure
- Organize components by domain (e.g., `layout`, `common`)
- Centralize all interfaces in a dedicated `interfaces` folder
- Structure pages in the `pages` directory based on routes

### 🧩 Component Design
- Build modular and reusable components
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define component props
- Follow the **Single Responsibility Principle**

### 🧼 Code Quality
- Use **ESLint** for linting
- Maintain consistent code style and formatting
- Write meaningful comments when necessary

### 🚀 Performance
- Optimize API calls
- Use lazy loading where applicable
- Style efficiently with Tailwind CSS utility classes

### 📝 Documentation
- Maintain a clear and up-to-date `README.md`
- Document props and usage for complex components
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

1. **Set up** the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. **Implement routing** via the Pages Router (`pages/`)
3. **Build components**:
    - Start with simple ones (`Card`, `Button`)
    - Continue with complex ones (`Modal`, `PostCard`, `UserCard`)
4. **Add layout** elements like `Header` for navigation
5. **Integrate API**: fetch data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
6. **Test** all components and pages as you build

---

## ✅ Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will have:

- A fully functional, responsive Next.js app
- Type-safe, reusable components
- Clean routing across pages (`/`, `/about`, `/posts`, `/users`, etc.)
- API integration with dynamic content display
- A well-organized and scalable codebase
